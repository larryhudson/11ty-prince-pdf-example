As you can see in the PDF, it's possible to adjust the PDF output using information from the document:

- you can add the current page number in the bottom corner
- you can add page numbers to hyperlinks (see the table of contents)
- you can include the document title in the header, and the current section title in the footer.

Prince makes this possible by using custom CSS rules.
