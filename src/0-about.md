This project was created by [Larry Hudson](https://www.twitter.com/larryhudsondev) in February 2022.

I have been working with accessible documents since I started at the [Information Access Group](https://www.informationaccessgroup.com/) in 2017. The vast majority of the documents that I've worked on have been Microsoft Word and Adobe InDesign documents.

While these formats make it possible to output accessible formats, I've always thought there must be a better way.

I've wanted a better tool to create accessible documents, and generate multiple output formats, from the same content.
